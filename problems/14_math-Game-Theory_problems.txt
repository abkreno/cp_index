1. UVa 00847 - A multiplication game (simulate the perfect play, discussed above)
2. UVa 10111 - Find the Winning ... * (Tic-Tac-Toe, minimax, backtracking)
3. UVa 10165 - Stone Game (Nim game, application of Sprague-Grundy theorem)
4. UVa 10368 - Euclid’s Game (minimax, backtracking, discussed in this section)
5. UVa 10404 - Bachet’s Game (2 players game, Dynamic Programming)
6. UVa 10578 - The Game of 31 (backtracking; try all; see who wins the game)
7. UVa 11311 - Exclusively Edible * (game theory, reducible to Nim game; we can view the game that Handel and Gretel are playing as Nim game, where there are 4 heaps - cakes left/below/right/above the topping; take the Nim sum of these 4 values and if they are equal to 0, Handel loses)
8. UVa 11489 - Integer Game * (game theory, reducible to simple math)
9. UVa 12293 - Box Game (analyze the game tree of smaller instances to get the mathematical insight to solve this problem)
10. UVa 12469 - Stones (game playing, Dynamic Programming, pruning)
