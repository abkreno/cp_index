1. UVa 00109 - Scud Busters (find CH, test if point inPolygon, area of polygon)
2. UVa 00137 - Polygons (convex polygon intersection, line segment intersection, inPolygon, CH, area, inclusion-exclusion principle)
3. UVa 00218 - Moth Eradication (find CH, perimeter of polygon)
4. UVa 00361 - Cops and Robbers (check if a point is inside CH of Cop/Robber; if a point pt is inside a convex hull, then there is definitely a triangle formed using three vertices of the convex hull that contains pt)
5. UVa 00478 - Points in Figures: ... (inPolygon/inTriangle; if the given polygon P is convex, there is another way to check if a point pt is inside or outside P other than the way mentioned in this section; we can triangulate P into triangles with pt as one of the vertex, then sum the areas of the triangles; if it is the same as the area of polygon P , then pt is inside P ; if it is larger, then pt is outside P )
6. UVa 00596 - The Incredible Hull (CH, output formatting is a bit tedious)
