1. UVa 00259 - Software Allocation * (discussed in this section)
2. UVa 00820 - Internet Bandwidth * (LA 5220, World Finals Orlando00, basic max flow, discussed in this section)
3. UVa 10092 - The Problem with the ... (assignment problem, matching with capacity, similar with UVa 259)
4. UVa 10511 - Councilling (matching, max flow, print the assignment)
5. UVa 10779 - Collectors Problem (max flow modeling is not straightforward; the main idea is to build a flow graph such that each augmenting path corresponds to a series of exchange of duplicate stickers, starting with Bob giving away one of his duplicates, and ending with him receiving a new sticker; repeat until this is no longer possible)
6. UVa 11045 - My T-Shirt Suits Me (assignment problem; but actually the input constraint is actually small enough for recursive backtracking)
7. UVa 11167 - Monkeys in the Emei ... * (max flow modeling; there are lots of edges in the flow graph; therefore, it is better to compress the capacity-1 edges whenever possible; use O(V 2 E) Dinicâ€™s max flow algorithm so that the high number of edges does not penalize the performance of your solution)
8. UVa 11418 - Clever Naming Patterns (two layers of matching, it may be easier to use max flow solution)

1. UVa 10330 - Power Transmission (max flow with vertex capacities)
2. UVa 10480 - Sabotage (straightforward min cut problem)
3. UVa 11380 - Down Went The Titanic * (discussed in this section)
4. UVa 11506 - Angry Programmer * (min cut with vertex capacities)
5. UVa 12125 - March of the Penguins * (max flow modeling with vertex capacities; another interesting problem, similar level with UVa 11380)
