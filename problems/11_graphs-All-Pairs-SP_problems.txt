1. UVa 00341 - Non-Stop Travel (graph is small)
2. UVa 00423 - MPI Maelstrom (graph is small)
3. UVa 00567 - Risk (simple SSSP solvable with BFS, but graph is small, so can be solved easier with Floyd Warshall’s)
4. UVa 00821 - Page Hopping * (LA 5221, World Finals Orlando00, one of the ‘easiest’ ICPC World Finals problem)
5. UVa 01233 - USHER (LA 4109, Singapore07, Floyd Warshall’s can be used to find the minimum cost cycle in the graph; the maximum input graph size is p ≤ 500 but still doable in UVa online judge)
6. UVa 01247 - Interstar Transport (LA 4524, Hsinchu09, APSP, Floyd Warshall’s, modified a bit to prefer shortest path with less intermediate vertices)
7. UVa 10171 - Meeting Prof. Miguel * (easy with APSP information)
8. UVa 10354 - Avoiding Your Boss (find boss’s shortest paths, remove edges involved in boss’s shortest paths, re-run shortest paths from home to market)
9. UVa 10525 - New to Bangladesh? (use two adjacency matrices: time and length; use modified Floyd Warshall’s)
10. UVa 10724 - Road Construction (adding one edge only changes ‘a few things’)
11. UVa 10793 - The Orc Attack (Floyd Warshall’s simplifies this problem)
12. UVa 10803 - Thunder Mountain (graph is small)
13. UVa 10947 - Bear with me, again.. (graph is small)
14. UVa 11015 - 05-32 Rendezvous (graph is small)
15. UVa 11463 - Commandos * (solution is easy with APSP information)
16. UVa 12319 - Edgetown’s Traffic Jams (Floyd Warshall’s 2x and compare)

1. UVa 00104 - Arbitrage * (small arbitrage problem solvable with FW)
2. UVa 00125 - Numbering Paths (modified Floyd Warshall’s)
3. UVa 00186 - Trip Routing (graph is small, print path)
4. UVa 00274 - Cat and Mouse (variant of transitive closure problem)
5. UVa 00436 - Arbitrage (II) (another arbitrage problem)
6. UVa 00334 - Identifying Concurrent ... * (transitive closure++)
7. UVa 00869 - Airline Comparison (run Warshall’s 2x, compare AdjMatrices)
8. UVa 00925 - No more prerequisites ... (transitive closure++)
9. UVa 01056 - Degrees of Separation * (LA 3569, World Finals SanAntonio06, diameter of a small graph)
10. UVa 01198 - Geodetic Set Problem (LA 2818, Kaohsiung03, trans closure++)
11. UVa 11047 - The Scrooge Co Problem (print path; special case: if origin = destination, print twice)
